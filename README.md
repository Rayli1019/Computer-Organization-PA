## Multiplier And Divider

In this Project we need to make a multiplier and divider using register, ALU, Control block through Verilog. To minimize the area I change the ALU 32 bit adder to 4 bit carry look ahead adder. Although the slack of the result may decrease about 1/5, the area have decrease around 32%. And the Divider I use the concept of the digital logic of 2 complement. So the area didn't increase a lot and the slack remain almost the same. The ranking concerning about area, slack and function about this project I get the first place . 

#### Score of this Project: 100
